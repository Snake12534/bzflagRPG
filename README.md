Bzflag's first RPG map/server in the making


Basically, in Bzflag's first RPG map, there are 10 battlefields (maps where you battle one anothe)(ricochet nation is one of the ten maps and is up and running right now!) There will be rounds of 3 mins each with a 30 second interval between the rounds. This interval is used for the players to access their data and buy "flags or items" that will give them an advantage. To understand what this means: in the rounds, each time you kill a tank, you will be given xx cash and xx experience points which are used in the " shop". You lose xx cash and gain a little exp each time you die from enemy fire. The shop will be opened and activated by using a command (aka /retexture etc) The amount of cash and exp is also opened by using the /command. Since bzflag 2.4 does not support GUI, commands are the only option available. Items in shop include: Temporary 3 live shield for the next round only for xx cash and little exp. Pernament lvl 1 tiny flag (lvl 1 being tiniest, lvl 4 being default size in bzflag) for more cash and exp. if you're a new player and you can't kill anyone, u r still awarded experience pts for the amt of time you are playing without being idle or being shot by enemy fire. Items like lvl 1 tiny would cost I.e. 50 cash, 100 exp, and the same item would be 5 cash, 600 exp as an example. More items will be in the shop but that is not our main goal. The goal right now as of 12/25/2013 is:

Finish by Jan 31, 2014
