BZFlag's First RPG in the making - Please read TODO for more information or email depchetunite@gmail.com (Snake12534)

Basic Information

==================

Maps

====


In BZFlag's RPG, there will be ten maps known as battlefield maps. Each map has a special name. The maps
will be switched every so often during the break of each rotation during a game. So far the maps created
is Ricochet Nation.

Currency

========

The user gains 'Gold' which can later be used to buy items in a shop. All of these actions will be accessed
through slash commands due to BZFlag's incapability of GUI.

Gameplay

=========

The user can earn 'Gold' by killing other tanks. A certain amount of 'x' gold will be given to each kill. The
games will be played as 3 minutes games and there will be a 30-45 second interval in-between for any player
to buy their items or check how much 'Gold' they have. How these games will start? This will be discussed in more
detail once the project has finished their TODO early goals.

Shop

====

The shop is a very important variable and feature in bzflagRPG. For now, they will be one 'special' item in the shop
that will make the tank superior in power over the other tanks. What the item or how the item will work, we
don't know as of right now.
