Here is the goal thinking like a BZFlag Player:

Create a plug - in so that when a tank hits another tank with a regular bullet (No Flag) you will then gain
Gold. With this gold, you can then buy a 'special' item that will be useful to you or the player.

Here is the goal thinking like a programmer:

Create one or a few plug - ins so that when a tank hits another tank with a regular bullet (No Flag) you will gain
virtual data known as "Gold." This "Gold" will be stored as Data. Since BZFlag can not support GUI,
the user may enter a slash command to access this data, aka "Gold." The user can also type a slash command
that will be the "Shop." In the Shop, the user can buy a 'special' item (The special item is very limited
due to BZFlag's requirements) that will increase the tank's mobility or strength. During this process,
the user will lose some of their data but will pernamently have a flag. What could be more interesting is an
equip and deequip button within the 'special' item.


Current Goals:

1) Make one of the ten maps - DONE

2) Plan the plug-in - INCOMPLETE

3) Start and Complete the plug-in - INCOMPLETE

4) Beta Test It - INCOMPLETE
